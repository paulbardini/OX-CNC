# OX-CNC
## Mod and parts created for Ox CNC type router

This is a repository for my mods and parts created for the OX CNC type router.

The Ox is a great open source cnc router and has been enjoyable to build and use.
- Here are links to other build - [www.openbuilds.com](http://www.openbuilds.com/?category=cnc-router-builds&id=286)
- As well here is the place where I purchased the parts for the mechanics - [Maker Store in Australia](http://www.makerstore.com.au/)

#### My Setup 
 - Ox CNC mechanical kit large (cut 1200 by 750)
 - GeckoDrive 5400
 - nema 23 steppers
 - Makita 730 Spindler trimmer router
 - Arduino and cnc shield - I control the G540 via the cnc shield not a computer parallel port.
 - [GRBL](https://github.com/grbl/grbl/wiki) firmware 
 - [Universal Gcode sender](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender)
 - [Bcnc Gcode Sender](https://github.com/vlachoudis/bCNC)
 - Toolpathing Autodesk Fusion
 
I have created a few things to help my setup do what I want it to do.
All files are available to upload and use. All the Cad file - in Solidworks format - are located here (link to come).
My only request is to fork or push new modifications to this reposiroty to future share.

#### Firstly Spindler Motor Holder

I couldn't find a suitable spindler holder and I really wanted something bomb proof. This was printed on a Up Box, which did an amazing job - solid. Fit perfectly first time and the spindle motor was snug - no movement.

[V-slot to Spindle Attachment stl](/CAD/spindler%20vslot%20attachment%20v1.STL)

[Spindle Clamp](/CAD/spindle%20clamp.STL)

The Ox has an annoying problem - once it is assembled, you cannot get t-nut into the slot; on some slots anyway.
I design a clip in t-nut limit switch holder. It snaps into position and then tigthen a crews to hold tight.

Thats it for now - more soon - please share-modify-create.

##### Research Description
This research seeks to better understand the open source framework and how it can be incorporated within the creative arts field to further innovation.
Open source is a paradigm of open collaboration and sharing, where ideas are developed within communities. These communities allow their ideas to be freely available for anyone to replicate, adapt or innovate upon the initial concept. Open source is commonly associated with the computer industry and is often misunderstood to be 'free and accessible software.' However, this definition is limited. Open source, correctly framed, is the dissemination of knowledge, an ideology of openness, transparency and innovation.
To create an understanding of how ideas can be disseminated within the open communities, this research project seeks to experiment with an online collaboration platform called Github, (https://github.com). This platform, traditionally used within software development, allows users to publicly share their work, encouraging collaboration and potential innovation. Although the GitHub is being utilised within other disciplines outside of software, there is great scope to investigate how the creative arts can benefit from this established and tested platform.   
The intention is to use GitHub to disseminate current and future project information, in order to investigate:
-	How people use this information.  Whether the published information is replicated or modified.
-	Ways in which this information is modified. Is the information used in unintentional ways?
GitHub structure allows the research to 
-	Communicate research objectives and information to participation. GitHub facilitates a comprehensive licencing protocol, allowing users to establish licencing agreements. This will also enable the communication of research intentions and information to participants about their involvement within the research project.
-	Follow people's use of the information (within the constraints of the GitHub platform). Through built-in analytics, traffic to GitHub can be tracked and reported.
-	GitHub has built-in chat, commenting and wiki facilities to collaborate with participants. As it is a membership based platform, members can be easily identified and contacted.
